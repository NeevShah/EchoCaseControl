==Echo Case Control==

This is a node.js application to be used with an Amazon Alexa Skill (for the Echo) to control Salesforce cases.

For more, including detailed installation instructions, [see the related blog post](http://joshbirk.herokuapp.com/sf1-how-to-setup-amazon-echo-case-control-for-salesforce/).  

This is basically a beta at this point, instructions and docs will be expanded as feedback rolls in.
